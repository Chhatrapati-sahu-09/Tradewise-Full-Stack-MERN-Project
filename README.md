  try {
    const { symbol } = req.params;
    const API_KEY = process.env.ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY;
    const response = await axios.get(

  }
});
```

Add to your `.env`:

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### MongoDB Setup

1. **Using MongoDB Atlas** (Recommended for production):
   - Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
   - Create a new cluster
   - Get your connection string
   - Update `backend/.env` with your connection string

2. **Using Local MongoDB**:
   - Install MongoDB locally
   - Update `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/zerodha
   ```

### Port Configuration

If you need to change the default ports, update:

- **Backend**: Change `PORT` in `backend/.env`
- **Frontend**: Runs on port 3000 by default (React default)
- **Dashboard**: Set `PORT` environment variable before starting

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Backend Code Limitations
Some advanced backend features are **not included** in this repository:
- User authentication & JWT implementation
- Payment gateway integration
- Advanced order validation logic
- Real-time WebSocket connections
- Rate limiting middleware
- Some proprietary trading algorithms

These were excluded due to:
- Security concerns with API keys
- Complexity that needs separate configuration
- Educational focus on core MERN concepts

The current version provides a **fully functional demo** with mock data support and can be extended based on your needs.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you see MongoDB connection errors:
1. Verify your connection string in `.env`
2. Check if your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
3. Ensure MongoDB service is running (for local setup)
4. The app will still run with limited functionality if DB is unavailable

### Port Already in Use

If you get "port already in use" errors:
```bash
# Windows
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Mac/Linux
killall node
```

### CORS Issues

Make sure the backend CORS configuration allows requests from your frontend URLs.

## 📦 Build for Production

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Dashboard
```bash
cd dashboard
npm run build
```

The production builds will be in the `build/` directories.
